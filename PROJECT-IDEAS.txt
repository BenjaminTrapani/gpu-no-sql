API-side:
* implement caching
* cache deleted entries and use update to create new entries in garbage's place.
* maintain doc list on cpu and move result aggregation to CPU.

GPU-side:
* look into streaming kernels to avoid host for loop when building results and examining selected
    elements of the same level.
* provide new functions to get entries for a doc for a specified depth in order to support cpu-side
    doc-list.
